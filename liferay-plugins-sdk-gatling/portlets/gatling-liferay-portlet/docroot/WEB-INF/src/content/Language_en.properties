help-description=This tool helps you create a simple script for Gatling with no knowledge of this program. Just use this tool and create a simple simulation quickly. Its supports 1.5, 2.0M3 and 2.0 RC1 templates.
help-content-intro=In order to stress load your site, follow the white rabbit :
help-content-step1=1. Create a simulation
help-content-step1-def=Click on Add Simulation button and name it.
help-content-step2=2. Create a scenario
help-content-step2-def=Click on Add Scenario, name it and choose the site where this scenario applies.
help-content-step3=3. Fill your scenario
help-content-step3-def=Write the missing details then add weight on pages you want to load, use checkboxes to force weight on multiple pages.
help-content-step4=4. Repeat from 2 as many time you want !
help-content-step4-def=Create a new scenario or skip and generate your simulation.
help-content-step5=5. Generate your simulation !
help-content-step5-def=On the simulation list, check your finished simulation, click on export and choose your Gatling's version.
help-use-scenario=How can I fill my scenario ?
help-use-scenario-info=Actually, it is simplier than you think. Just fill the weight on pages you want to load, see the percent of load it corresponds. That it. Checkboxes are optionals, you only use them to select and force weight on multiple pages.
help-use-scenario-empty=A blue line means a empty weight, this page that won't be added to the scenario when you generate your script.
help-use-scenario-colors=We use symbols and colors system to warn you about new pages or deleted pages after the creation of your scenario. 
help-use-scenario-green=A green line in scenario in a new page on the website and not yet in your scenario. 
help-use-scenario-red=A Red line is a deleted page on your site but still in your scenario.
help-use-scenario-save=When you save in this conditions you will upgrade your scenario the match the current sitemap of your website.

help-faq=Frequently Asked Questions
help-faq-export-simulation=Why I can't check the simulation I want to export ?
help-faq-export-simulation-answer=You can only export completed simulation. The simulation state must be like this : 
help-faq-scenario-colors=When I edit my scenario I have green, red and blue lines !
help-faq-scenario-colors-answer=Don't panic ! Blue is for line with empty weight, Green is page in your site but not in your scenario (ie page created AFTER you created scenario). Red is the opposite of green, in scenario but not in your site (ie page deleted). Saving will upgrade your scenario and the green and red lines will no longer be colored.
help-faq-scenario-weight=What is a weight ?
help-faq-scenario-weight-answer=A weight is a number you choose. it corresponds to a load on your pages. Weight itself means nothing, look at the percents to understand the load on your page.
