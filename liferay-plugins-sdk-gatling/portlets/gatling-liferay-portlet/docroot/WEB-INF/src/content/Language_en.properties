help-description=This tool helps you create a simple script for Gatling with no knowledge of this program. You just have to use the interface to add, remove or generate a simple simulation.

help_content1=How to use the Stress Tool Portlet?
help_content2=In order to stress your site, follow the white rabbit :
help_content3=Create a simulation by pressing the button "Add Simulation": a simulation may correspond to one or many scenarios.
help_content4=Create a first scenario, a scenario apply to all the pages of a single site only. 
help_content5=Once created, you can edit your fresh new scenario by cliking on it. You are redirect to the list of the pages you will stress on the site.
help_content6=Choose the pages you want to test by ticking the checkbox on the left side.
help_content7=Next, your page need a weight, this is a number of your choice and correspond to a load. Try it yourself and you will see on the right side the percent of loads it actually represent.
help_content8=If you see green line, its means this page is new and not in the scenario ; red is the opposite, the page doesn't exist anymore but still in the scenario. Saving with this conditions will upgrade your scenario schema (ie add green and remove red).
help_content9=Then go the second fieldset to edit the details of the scenario. For now it is only two field user/s and the duration
help_content10=Once you have fill the field, you can save.
help_content11=You have created your first scenario ! You can add a new one or generate the script. 
help_content12=Each scenario have three states, Empty, Incomplete, Finish. This will show your quickly which scenario is not ready to use.
help_content13=Simulation works the same way with three states. You can export your simulation only if it is completed. If it is, click and download your script and try it out in gatling now !
