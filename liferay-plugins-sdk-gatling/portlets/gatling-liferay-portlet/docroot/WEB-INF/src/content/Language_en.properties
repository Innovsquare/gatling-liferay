help-description=This tool helps you create a simple script for Gatling with no knowledge of this program. Just use this tool and create a simple simulation quickly. It supports 1.5, 2.0M3 and 2.0 RC1 templates.
help-content-intro=In order to stress load your site, follow the white rabbit :
help-content-step1=1. Create a simulation
help-content-step1-def=Click on "Add Simulation" and name it.
help-content-step2=2. Create a scenario
help-content-step2-def=Click on "Add Scenario", name it and choose the site on which this scenario applies.
help-content-step3=3. Fill your scenario
help-content-step3-def=Write the missing details then add weight on pages you want to load. Use checkboxes to force the weight on multiples pages.
help-content-step4=4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 as many times as you want !
help-content-step4-def=Create a new scenario or skip and generate your simulation.
help-content-step5=5. Generate your simulation !
help-content-step5-def=On the simulation list, tick your finished simulation, click on export and choose your Gatling's version.
help-use-scenario=How can I fill my scenario ?
help-use-scenario-info=Actually, it is easier than you think. Just fill the weight on pages you want to set a load, see the percent of load corresponding. That's it. Checkboxes are optionals, you only use them to select multiple lines and force weight on multiple pages.
help-use-scenario-empty=A <span style='background-color:#E5F5FC'>blue</span> line means a empty weight. This page won't be added to the scenario when you will generate your script.
help-use-scenario-colors=We use a system with colors and symbols to warn you about new pages or deleted pages after the creation of your scenario. 
help-use-scenario-green=A <span style='background-color:#F1FBD1'>green</span> line means a new page was added to the website but has not yet been added to your scenario. 
help-use-scenario-red=A <span style='background-color:#FEE5E2'>red</span> line is a deleted page on your site but still in your scenario.
help-use-scenario-save=When you save in this conditions you will upgrade your scenario to match the current sitemap of your website.

help-faq=Frequently Asked Questions
help-faq-export-simulation=Why can't I check my simulation that I want to export ?
help-faq-export-simulation-answer=You can only export already completed simulations. The simulation state must be like this : 
help-faq-scenario-colors=When I edit my scenario I have blue, green and red lines !
help-faq-scenario-colors-answer=Don't panic ! Blue is for pages with empty weight, green for pages which exist on your site but not in your scenario (ie page created AFTER you created scenario). Red is the opposite of green: these are pages which exist in your scenario but not on your site (ie page deleted). Save will upgrade your scenario and the green and red lines will no longer be colored.
help-faq-scenario-weight=What is a weight ?
help-faq-scenario-weight-answer=A weight is a number you choose. It corresponds to a load on your page. Weight alone means nothing, look at the percents to understand the load on your page.
