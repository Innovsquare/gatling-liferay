help-faq=Frequently Asked Questions
help-faq-export-simulation=Why can't I check my simulation that I want to export ?
help-faq-export-simulation-answer=You can only export already completed simulations. The simulation state must be like this :
help-faq-scenario-colors=When I edit my scenario I have blue, green and red lines !
help-faq-scenario-colors-answer=Don't panic ! Blue is for pages with empty weight, green for pages which exist on your site but not in your scenario (ie page created AFTER you created scenario). Red is the opposite of green: these are pages which exist in your scenario but not on your site (ie page deleted). Save will upgrade your scenario and the green and red lines will no longer be colored.
help-faq-scenario-weight=What is a weight ?
help-faq-scenario-weight-answer=A weight is a number you choose. It corresponds to a load on your page. Weight alone means nothing, look at the percents to understand the load on your page.
help-gatling-download=You can download the last version of Gatling on the official website.

help-use-scenario-empty=A <span style='background-color:#E5F5FC'>blue</span> line means a empty weight. This page won't be added to the scenario when you will generate your script.
help-use-scenario-green=A <span style='background-color:#F1FBD1'>green</span> line means a new page was added to the website but has not yet been added to your scenario.
help-use-scenario-info=Actually, it is easier than you think. Just fill the weight on pages you want to set a load, see the percent of load corresponding. That's it. Checkboxes are optionals, you only use them to select multiple lines and force weight on multiple pages.
help-use-scenario-red=A <span style='background-color:#FEE5E2'>red</span> line is a deleted page on your site but still in your scenario.
